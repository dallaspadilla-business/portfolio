      <h3>About Me</h3>
      I’m Dallas Padilla, a full‑stack software engineer with a passion for crafting intuitive,
      visually engaging user experiences. My journey began in college, where I designed and built
      mobile games for iOS and even took a shot at launching my own app‑based startup. Those early
      projects sparked my love for frontend development and taught me the value of blending
      creativity with technical precision. Since then, I’ve spent the past three years delivering
      scalable, high‑quality web applications across diverse tech stacks — from Angular and React on
      the frontend to Spring Boot and ASP.NET on the backend. I’ve managed cloud infrastructure in
      Azure and AWS, collaborated seamlessly with cross‑functional teams, and thrived in fast‑paced
      environments where balancing speed and maintainability is key. Whether I’m architecting
      complex systems or refining a single UI interaction, my goal is the same: build clean,
      maintainable code that solves real problems and delights users.
